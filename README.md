# fonix
Portuguese Sound "fó":

* /ˈfɔ/ - Voiceless labiodental fricative followed by an open-mid back rounded vowel, with the primary stress on this syllable.

English Sound "nix":

* /niks/ - Voiced alveolar nasal, close front unrounded vowel, voiceless velar plosive, and voiceless alveolar fricative.

Putting it together, the phonetics for the Portuguese word "Fónix" would be:

* /ˈfɔ/ /niks/

If you're Portuguese, changes are you know what I said just there.
